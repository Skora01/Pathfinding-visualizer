Welcome to Pathfinding visualizer.

You can use this project to visualize pathfinding algorithms and play with them with ability
to create a random maze, put wall/obstacles to draw your own maze and also have fun with it.
**Obstacles** are just nodes with more weight than regular nodes(it costs more to go through them).

You can access it here:

(Turn off the add blocker if using Mozilla Firefox!)
## Showcase of algorithms:

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** - weighted pathfinding algorithm that guarantees the shortest path.
Weighted means it can go through obstacles.

**A** * **search** - the best pathfinding algorithm. Uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest
path. Also weighted.

**Breath-First-Search** - unweighted algorithm that guarantees the shortest path.

**Depth-First-Search** - unweighted algorithm that doesn't guarantee the shortest path, very
slow and usually not used as pathfinding algorithm.

**Recursive Division** - maze generating algorithm. Randomly chooses row/collumn for creating
walls and recursively repeats.
